# Iteration 0031

# Kuiper: the engineering behind this site, and the code behind any line of it

## What it does

Every piece of engineering work on this site is placed on one disc: oldest in the middle, newest at
the rim, each piece of work its own small arc. Tap a dot to see what that work was and the day it
was done. Where the code for that line is carried here, the page shows it: ten lines above the
tapped line, ten below, the tapped line marked, and a link that opens that exact line on GitHub as
it stood that day.

## What changed in this version

- The Kuiper now has one permanent address, and from here on it is improved a part at a time rather
  than replaced whole. The page a visitor opens checks every part against a fingerprint before it
  runs it; a part that does not match is refused and the page says so in plain words; and any change
  can be taken back in one step. What a visitor sees and does is unchanged by this: every check the
  page had before still passes on it.
- On a phone the Kuiper is now the main event. The seven applications are behind one button, APPS,
  the top of the screen is the one word KUIPER, and the disc has the room. Nothing is removed: one
  tap opens the row, and choosing an application puts it away again. A desktop is as it was. The
  warranty line is on the screen at every size.

## What it is for

- Find when a calculation, a drawing or a data set was first written, and read it as it stood that day.
- Send somebody the address of one line, or of one whole piece of work.
- See at a glance how much of the engineering behind this site is drawing, how much is data, and when
  it was done.

## Still to come

Previous and next line without leaving the sheet. A line saying which application a piece of code
belongs to, and a button that opens that application. The code carried for every file, rather than
only the ones carried so far.

## What this is not

Not a design, not a rating and not a connection offer. Provided as is, without warranty of any kind;
a chart, not a design.
