# Iteration 0038

# Kuiper: the page's own checks for code on every dot

## What changed in this release

Nothing a visitor sees. The checks the page runs on itself now require that a dot whose file is not carried here shows the code its piece of work changed, read from where the work is publicly kept, with the marked line checked against the file as fetched; and they measure, on 200 taps chosen by a fixed seed, how many show real code.
