# Iteration 0040

# Kuiper: the header stays

## What changed in this release

- When "See the code behind this" is opened, the application at the top of the card now stays where it is and the code scrolls beneath it. Before, the card scrolled down to the code and the application, its name and its OPEN button went out of the top: the one thing most visitors came for was gone the moment somebody asked to see the code.
- While the code is open the head folds to its essentials, the name and OPEN, so that on a phone there is still room for the code under it. Closing the code gives the rest back.
