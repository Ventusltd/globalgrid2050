# Iteration 0014

# The engineering record, and the code behind any line of it

## What it does

Every piece of engineering work on this site is placed on one disc: oldest in the middle, newest at
the rim, each piece of work its own small arc. Tap a dot to see what that work was and the day it
was done. Where the code for that line is carried here, the page shows it: ten lines above the
tapped line, ten below, the tapped line marked, and a link that opens that exact line on GitHub as
it stood that day.

## What changed in this version

- Tapping a dot whose code is not carried here now answers in plain words: what the work was, the
  day it was done, one link that opens that piece of work on GitHub, and one sentence saying the
  code for that line is not carried here yet. It used to answer with address arithmetic and an
  instruction to run a program, which is almost every tap a stranger makes.
- A link is drawn only where the work is provably public. Where it is not, the card says so, and
  there is no link and no name.
- NEW CODE answers the same way: how many pieces of work, how many lines were added, what it begins
  with and when.
- The button that returns to the whole picture says WHOLE VIEW.

## What it is for

- Find when a calculation, a drawing or a data set was first written, and read it as it stood that day.
- Send somebody the address of one line, or of one whole piece of work.
- See at a glance how much of the engineering behind this site is drawing, how much is data, and when
  it was done.

## Still to come

Previous and next line without leaving the sheet. A line saying which application a piece of code
belongs to, and a button that opens that application. The code carried for every file, rather than
only the ones carried so far.

## What this is not

Not a design, not a rating and not a connection offer. Provided as is, without warranty of any kind;
a chart, not a design.
